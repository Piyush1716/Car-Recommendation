            Difference Between Item-Based and User-Based Recommendations

Item-Based Recommendations:
    Basis of Comparison: Items (cars) are compared to other items based on how they are interacted with by users. The idea is that if a user interacts with two similar cars, those cars are considered alike, regardless of which user interacted with them.
    How Similarity is Calculated: The similarity between items (cars) is computed based on the patterns of interactions with users. For example, if many users interact similarly with cars A and B, they are considered similar.
    Recommendation Approach: After identifying the cars the user has interacted with, the system recommends cars similar to those based on the interaction patterns of all users, not just the individual user.

User-Based Recommendations:
    Basis of Comparison: Users are compared to other users based on their interactions with items (cars). The idea is that if two users have similar tastes or behavior in terms of the cars they interact with, then they are considered similar.
    How Similarity is Calculated: The similarity between users is calculated based on how similarly they interact with the same cars. For instance, if User A and User B like the same cars, they are considered similar.
    Recommendation Approach: After identifying similar users to the current user, the system recommends cars that these similar users have interacted with, but the current user hasn't yet interacted with.

Key Differences
Focus:
    Item-Based: Focuses on the items (cars) and their relationships to one another.
    User-Based: Focuses on users and their similarity based on their interactions.
Recommendation Source:
    Item-Based: Recommends cars based on items that are similar to what the user has interacted with.
    User-Based: Recommends cars that similar users have interacted with.
